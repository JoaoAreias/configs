# Python

This folder contains a series of conda environments designed for specific tasks and projects. It should be my starting point when creating a new Python project.

## Conda environments

- `base.yml`: This configuration includes the most stripped-down environment I use, it includes some packages to ensure code quality
- `data_science.yml`: Contains the dependencies I use when starting a data science project, including but not limited to:
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Jupyter
  - Kedro
  - MLFlow
  - Plotly
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
